## **0-whatsmyname.c**:

**Description**: This C program, when executed, prints the name of the program itself (including any path if provided when running the program) followed by a newline character. It utilizes the argv array, specifically argv[0], to access and display the program's name. This simple utility allows you to see the program's current name without the need for recompilation, making it particularly useful if you rename the executable file while retaining the same compiled binary.
